        <h2>What is Comprehensive Coverage?</h2>
        <p>Comprehensive coverage is a type of insurance that provides extensive protection against a wide range of risks, including theft, natural disasters, vandalism, and accidental damage. Unlike basic policies that cover only specific incidents, comprehensive insurance ensures that you are financially protected in almost any scenario.</p>

        <h2>Key Benefits of Comprehensive Coverage</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Protection against natural disasters such as floods, storms, and fires</li>
            <li>Coverage for theft and vandalism</li>
            <li>Financial security against accidental damage</li>
            <li>Peace of mind with extensive coverage for your assets</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Who Needs Comprehensive Coverage?</h2>
        <p>Comprehensive insurance is ideal for individuals and businesses looking to protect valuable assets. Whether you own a home, a vehicle, or a business, this type of coverage ensures that you do not face significant financial losses due to unforeseen events.</p>

        <h2>How Does Comprehensive Coverage Work?</h2>
        <p>When an insured event occurs, you can file a claim with your insurance provider to receive compensation for the damages. The policy typically covers repairs, replacements, and other costs associated with the loss, helping you recover quickly without financial strain.</p>
